# Comproso Framework Package

Comproso is a PHP framework for web and computer based testing in behavioral sciences, especially psychology.

## Warning
### Disclaimer
Comproso is an Open Source software under AGPL-3.0 license. Nonetheless, behavioral assessment requires the consideration of ethical and legal issues for test developers (authors), test publishers (providers), and test users. See the [ITC Guidlines](https://www.intestcom.org/page/5) for an example.

**Use this framework only in consideration of ethical and legal issues!**

### Notice
We only support responsible and ethical usage of our framework.

### developemental status
This software is still under development. Even if it could run stable, a proper configuration requires some knowledge using [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and [laravel](https://laravel.com/). Someday, a ready to run installation bundle will be provided. If you are having trouble during setup/installation/configuration/using the framework, feel free to ask for [support](https://github.com/comproso/framework/issues).

### Notice
Be aware that Comproso uses *sessions*. You shouldn't use `cookie` as session driver option to avoid compromising possibilities. We recommend to use redis.

## Information for test authors
Even if AGPL is forcing code forks also to publish under AGPL license, a test (or a project) is not: As tests are "only" linked to the framework, proprietary are imaginable. We strongly recommend a copyleft license, see [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com) and [comproso.org/os](https://comproso.org/os) for further information. ** Be aware of ethical and legal issues due to test publishing! **
